My name is Huy Minh Tran and I graduated from UCI in 06/2020. I'm a Software Engineer. Here is a bit about me:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Golang and Docker.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on heavy Back-end projects so I can enhance my knowledge in that domain.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about REST, GraphQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL. The more questions, the more I can learn.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: huyminhtran@proton.me
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't eat sushi because I don't like raw food.
